This is a story about a all powerful super robot named Mo, he has the advantage of both being a robot and a superhuman.
He is the product of seceret goverment research,the attempt at the a ultimate superpower.During experimentation however Mo grew to be self-aware, and ultimatly more and more powerful
with time. He felt imprisoned and broke out of the facility, and decided to use his powers for good, and help the opressed just like he was.

However, while he was carrying on his mission, he was stopped by the opposition, his greatest foe, Bo. Bo doesn't have any super power but he is rich and he has a lot of cool and high technology
gadgets. They ended up on a tense fight, just before Bo was abit to kill Mo, Mo shouted... "MARTA".

Then, Bo, remembering his mom, Marta, shouted "WHY DID YOU SAY THAT NAME??"
Mo said that Bo was letting Marta die by fighting him, and while Bo was dubious
about the truth and circumstances of this development, decided that it was
not worth the risk and let Mo go to find Marta.

As soon as Bo let go of Mo, Mo leapt to his feet and immediatly took Bo to an abandoned basement in a warehouse. They crept in slowly and carefully, and 
they both entered the door, where Marta, Bo's mother who had left him at a tender age, was slowly dying of a heart attack. Despite all the fancy gadgets 
that he had, Bo did not have anything he could use to save his mother in that moment. But Mo used his powers of flight to fly Marta to a nearby hospital,
where she was treated. Mo had set out to do exactly what he said he would; use his powers for good. And so, Marta was saved; and so, indirectly, was Bo.
Mo was a superhero for the people and of the people, and used his powers for the rest of his cyborg life to do good by them.
